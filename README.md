# Portfolio | Sharon D. Souto
Welcome! I'm Sharon Souto, a data analyst (and former data engineer and architect!) with a passion for extracting insights and transforming data into actionable knowledge.  I leverage my skills in data wrangling, analysis, and visualization to solve complex business problems and drive informed decision-making.  After years of building and maintaining data pipelines, I've transitioned my expertise to unlock the insights hidden within that data. My experience gives me a deep understanding of the data lifecycle, from its raw state to its analytical potential.

This portfolio showcases a selection of my projects that demonstrate my ability to:

* ***Clean and prepare data:*** I can handle messy datasets, ensuring their accuracy and completeness for effective analysis.
* ***Perform insightful analysis:*** I utilize various analytical techniques to uncover hidden trends and patterns within data.
* ***Create compelling visualizations:*** I translate complex data into clear and concise visuals that effectively communicate findings.
* ***Communicate effectively:*** I can present my findings to both technical and non-technical audiences in a clear and actionable way.

I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my data analysis skillset.  I'm confident that my enthusiasm for data, combined with my analytical and problem-solving abilities, can make me a valuable asset to your team.

Let's explore how data can unlock opportunities!
